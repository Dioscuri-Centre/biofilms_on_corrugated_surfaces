code and data for the paper "Substrate geometry affects population dynamics in a bacterial biofilm"
co-authored by Witold Postek, Klaudia Staskiewicz, Elin Lilja, and Bartlomiej Waclaw

To re-create figures from the main text and the Supplementary Information, run all Mathematica and Jupyter notebooks. 
To create only a single chosen figure, run the corresponding notebook only,. e.g. for Figure 1 run Fig_1.ipynb

Supplementary Videos:

SI_Video_1.mp4 - biofilm growth in selected wells (as in Fig. 1) over the course of 65 h.

SI_Video_2.mp4 - biofilm growth in 4 wells of different type: flat, (T,A)=(10,1.7), (T,A)=(20,5.1), and (T,A)=(50,8.7).

SI_Video_3.mp4 - simulated biofilm in an 80x70 um well, for the same parameters as simulations presented in Fig. 4.

SI_Video_4.mp4 - simulated biofilm in an 80x30 um well, for the same parameters as SI_Video_3.mp4

SI_Video_5.mp4 - simulated biofilm in an 80x30 um well, for the same parameters as SI_Video_3.mp4 with the exception of the friction coefficient being 20x larger.
